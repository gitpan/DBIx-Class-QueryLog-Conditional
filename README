NAME
    DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Conditional - Disable QueryLogger instead of all
    query logging

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
     my $ql = DBIx::Class:::QueryLog->new;
     $schema->storage->debugobj(
        DBIx::Class:::QueryLog::Tee->new(
             loggers => {
                new      => $ql,
                original => DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Conditional->new(
                   logger => $self->storage->debugobj,
                   enabled_method => sub { $ENV{DBIC_TRACE} },
                ),
             },
        ),
     );
     $schema->storage->debug(1);

    Now the original storageobj is enabled and disabled based on the
    standard env var.

DESCRIPTION
    When you use DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Tee you will likely find that
    suddenly you are logging everything. Before "::Tee" came along your
    console was inconsolable, dispondant; you never heard from it again.
    After using "::Tee" suddenly your silent, morose query log became manic.
    It woudln't shut up! This was not what you bargained for...

    "DBIx::Class::QueryLog::Conditional" is part of The Final Equation.
    Instead of no noise, or all noise, "::Conditional" is the bear that
    gives you just the right amount and temperature of porridge.

METHODS
  "new"
    Requires a "logger" that must be a "LOGGER". Can optionally take either
    "enabled" or "enabled_method".

    "enabled" is a simple bool, defaulting to true.

    "enabled_method" is a code reference called as a method. It defaults to
    checking "enabled". A good alternate is proposed in the "SYNOPSIS".

  "enabled"
    A simple helper attribute. Defaults to true, can be set to false to turn
    off your logger via code.

LOGGER
    A logger is defined as an object that has the following methods:

       txn_begin txn_commit txn_rollback
       svp_begin svp_release svp_rollback
       query_start query_end
